# Overview
Project 6 is an opportunity to create your own custom exploratory data analysis (EDA) project using GitHub, Git, Jupyter, pandas, Seaborn and other popular data analytics tools.

# Objectives
1) to create a dataset from publicly available 
2) to explore what states have the most events related to thunderstorms.  This includes wind, hail, and tornados.
3) 


# Lessons learned
- Don't try to upload large csv files to github.  It is a big hassle to try and fix this!
